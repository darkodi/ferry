# Threat model

STRIDE analysis per component and trust boundary. Each component adds its section when it is built (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Trust boundaries

| # | Boundary | Crossed by | Since |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TB1 | Ferry binaries → Postgres | SQL as the `ferry_app` role | M1 |
| TB2 | Operator / migrations → Postgres | SQL as the schema owner | M1 |

Later milestones add the public API, inbound rail webhooks, chain RPC and the queue.

## Ledger (M1)

**Assets:** account balances (`accounts.posted`) and the journal (`journal_entries`, `postings`), the source of truth for who owns what.

**Assumptions:**

- Application code may have bugs; the database must still refuse an invalid ledger.
- The `ferry_app` credentials may leak through an application compromise.
- The schema owner and Postgres superuser are trusted. They are used only by migrations and operators, never by the running binaries.

### STRIDE

| Threat | Example | Mitigation | Verified by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **S**poofing | A binary connects as the schema owner and bypasses grants | `ferry_app` is `NOLOGIN`; deployments create a separate login role that inherits it; owner credentials are not given to services | `TestAppRoleCannotLogIn` |
| **T**ampering: unbalanced entry | Bug or attacker posts debits ≠ credits, creating or destroying money | Deferred constraint trigger checks each entry at `COMMIT`: ≥ 2 postings, Σdebits = Σcredits per currency; also re-checks lines appended to old entries | `TestUnbalancedEntryRejectedAtCommit`, `TestEntryWithoutPostingsRejected`, `TestEntryWithOnePostingRejected`, `TestPostingAddedLaterToCommittedEntryRejected` |
| **T**ampering: rewriting history | Edit or delete a posting to hide a transfer | `ferry_app` has no `UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`TRUNCATE` on entries or postings; `BEFORE` triggers reject them for every role, including the owner | `TestAppRolePrivileges`, `TestEntriesAndPostingsAppendOnlyEvenForOwner` |
| **T**ampering: overdraft | Customer balance driven below zero | `CHECK (owner_id IS NULL OR posted >= 0)`; Go also checks after locking (next PR) | `TestCustomerAccountCannotGoNegative` |
| **T**ampering: re-labelling an account | Change an account's `kind` or `owner_id` to move funds between customers | `ferry_app` may update only `posted` and `updated_at` | `TestAppRolePrivileges` |
| **T**ampering: malformed amounts | Zero, negative or overflowing amounts | `CHECK (amount > 0 AND amount <= 2^63-1)`; `posted` limited to the `int64` range | `TestPostingAmountBounds` |
| **T**ampering: wrong currency | A posting in a currency other than its account's | Composite FK `(account_id, currency)`; v1 allows only `USDC` | `TestPostingCurrencyMustMatchAccount`, `TestAccountKindAndCurrencyValid` |
| **R**epudiation | "That entry never happened" | Append-only journal; every entry has a unique deterministic `idempotency_key` and `created_at` | `TestIdempotencyKeyUnique` |
| **I**nformation disclosure | Balances read by an unauthorised party | DB not exposed outside the private network (local: bound to 127.0.0.1; AWS: private subnet, M7); API authorisation from M2 | — (M2, M7) |
| **D**enial of service | Hot house accounts serialise all payouts on their row locks | Accepted for v1; Evolution section describes sharding house accounts | — |
| **E**levation of privilege | `ferry_app` creates objects or grants itself rights | No `CREATE` on schema `public` (Postgres 15+ default) and no ownership | `TestAppRolePrivileges` ("create table") |

### Residual risks

- **`posted` can drift from the postings.** `ferry_app` can set `posted` to any non-negative value without a matching entry. The Go ledger updates it only inside `PostEntry`, and the invariant job (posted = Σ postings) detects drift. A database-level trigger tying `posted` to postings was rejected for v1 to keep the schema simple.
- **Double posting under a different key.** The database cannot tell that two entries with different `idempotency_key`s describe the same event. Deterministic keys built by `internal/ledger/rules.go` make this a code-review concern.
- **Owner and superuser are trusted.** They can drop the triggers. This is accepted: they run migrations only, and their use belongs in an audit log (M7).
